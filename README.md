# Mobile-and-Wearable

## IDEA:

### TITLE: WORKFLOW GUARDIAN 
- Productivity bodyguard. The application feel when the user is focused (like studying/coding) thanks to its lower heartbeat and activate silent mode (do not disturb on iphone), so something that remove notification, thus avoid distractions.
- On the other side, when the heartbeat is not so stable and the user start to move a little bit more, well that's the right time for a break. The app understand this and with a notification advertise the user that this is the right moment for a break.
- This system of focusing and doing smart brake in our opinion allows for more productivity.
