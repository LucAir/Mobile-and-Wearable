### TITLE: WORKFLOW GUARDIAN 
Have you ever wonder how is the feeling of working / studying protected by a guardian?? What no?? Well it's time to experiment 😊.

#### How does it work
- Suppose you want to study and you are bored of the classic application where appears only a timer and a small character to be customized. You decide to try something new and you fall into
  WorkflowGuardian.
- Once you open the application a Registration is required, but don't worry it's very fast!
- Once logged-in for the first time a small test is required. You stay very chill for 2 minutes and we will record you heartbeat.
- Why do we need it??
  -  Heartbeat recording is used to metrix such as: "Heart-Rate" and "Heart-Rate-Variability". This information are stored in our database and used for our stress detection model. This has been done to keep our "Fake machine learning model" (as decided in class: use just an if-else), as precise as possible.
- Now after this test you are ready to explore the application. In the home page you      see a timer set to zero.
- If you click it, a study-session will start. In this page to avoid distraction you      can also set the notification to be disabled.

#### Features
Well now you are wondering about what's differe our application from the one in the market:
- We have a customizable character, a real guardian. Once you created an account, we gift you with 500 token. Every one minute that you stay focused a token will be added to you account. With this token you can buy skin to the guardian, change its background and also assign a pet to him (so it does not feel lonely🥺)
- Then suppose you are little bit nerd 🤓 and you like chart. We have created a customize section for you. In Analitics📊 you can find 2 differnt type of plot that shows you how the session are going:
  - LineChart: gives you details about the last session (the one previously concluded).Shows in green the period of time where you were focused, and with 2 kind of point (red and yellow) where you lost the attention (red) and where you could have lost the attention / focus is dropping, but you are still able to study.
  - Boxplot: this visualization instead allows you to compare different session and just by clicking you will se the number of distraction in each section. On y axis there are hearbeat so that you will se in which section you were more agitated.
  - For the third visualization we accept suggestion, so be creative and tell us what you want to see❤️
